Can I explain what my code does?

My index.html is a personal resume webpage. It has different sections:
About: A brief introduction about me.
Skills: Lists my abilities and strengths.
Experience: Shows my work and volunteering experiences.
All images are stored in an assets folder, which keeps the files organized and easy to use in the page.

What was my coding process?

I first planned how I wanted my resume to look. Then, I wrote the HTML step by step, creating sections for each part. I made small commits in Git as I added features, so it was easy to track changes. I tested the page in a browser and fixed small errors to make sure everything displayed correctly.

What challenges did I have?

I faced a few issues:
Some HTML validation errors like missing closing tags. I fixed them by carefully checking my code.
Git push authentication caused problems at first, but I solved it by reconnecting my GitHub account.

What would I do differently now?

Next time, I would:
Add CSS to make it look nicer.
Make it responsive so it works on phones and tablets.
Use more semantic HTML tags to make the code cleaner and easier to read.
